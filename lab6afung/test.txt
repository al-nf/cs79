rosterllist provides the implementation for a linked list, its nodes, and its iterator. So we would need to test the functionality of all these:
1. Make a new list. (tests the list constructor)
2. Insert a node into the list. (tests the node constructor and insert)
3. Insert multiple nodes into the list. (tests insert)
4. Delete multiple nodes from the list. (tests erase)
5. Iterate through the list, printing out the contents of its nodes. (tests iterator and its functions)
